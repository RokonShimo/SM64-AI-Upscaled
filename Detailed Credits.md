# Game Programming

The original Super Mario 64 belongs to Nintendo.

Jiggly Wiggly's Super Dash was created for use with Render96, a mod of onyyx300's Super Mario 64 PC Port created by the Render96 team. Information about Render96 can be found through [this link.](https://linktr.ee/Render96)

I recommend using sm64pcBuilder2 to compile Render96 for use with this project. This tool was made by gunvalk & Filipianosol & GammaTendonNine, and can be found [here.](https://sm64pc.info/sm64pcbuilder2/)

Thank you to various members of the PC Port Central Discord server (whose names I did not consider writing down at the time) for assisting me with the making of this project. The server is linked on [this page.](https://www.sm64pc.info/)

# Asset Generation

Almost all assets and text used in Jiggly Wiggly's Super Dash were generated using one of two Google Colab notebooks published by Max Woolf before being manually vetted and edited by myself, intermittently using official assets from Super Mario 64 in the process. The text-generating notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce) and is powered by GPT-2, and the image-generating notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wkF67ThUz37T2_oPIuSwuO4e_-0vjaLs) and is based on work by Katherine Crowson and Ahsen Khaliq.

# Software Used

All image editing work was performed by myself using [paint.net,](https://getpaint.net) a free and intuitive image editor developed by Rick Brewster. Text editing and formatting was done using Notepad++, a free and open source IDE developed by Don Ho.

# Fonts Used
All fonts used during gameplay are composed of glyphs from [Deep Script 2](https://www.are.na/block/9886838) by Maxim Leyzerovich where possible and edited versions of the original fonts otherwise. The font used for the credits was generated using VQGAN+CLIP (listed above) using the original font as a base, heavily edited by myself to ensure legibility.

Legible text used in textures, including my signature in the opening cutscene (replacing Peach's), is written in Lucida Calligraphy. Lucida Calligraphy was designed by Charles Bigelow and Chris Holmes.

The strange symbols on the ending screens read *jan Imo*, my name written in *toki pona*. This uses the font [*linja pona*](http://musilili.net/linja-pona/), created by David A Roberts and *jan Same* with the help of *pali tan jan Wesi*. *toki pona* was first invented by Sonja Lang.
