Jiggly Wiggly's Super Dash was created using algorithms that are deliberately unfit for purpose in order to avoid coherent results, and any content generated using such algorithms was manually vetted and edited by myself prior to inclusion. To the best of my ability, I have credited all persons without whom this project would not be possible, and ensured that any copyrighted material included is used under Fair Use. I do not claim to own any such material.

I believe that any algorithm that performs a task without a provably correct answer should be used by a human rather than instead of one, especially if its use could potentially cause material harm.

Training data for learning algorithms should only be collected and used with the explicit consent of the original author(s).

No learning algorithm can be a reliable source of factual information, and failing to communicate this to any end user of such an algorithm is an act of criminal negligence.
